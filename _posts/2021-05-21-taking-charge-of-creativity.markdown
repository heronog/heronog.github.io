excerpt: How and Why to separate fulfillment and creativity from career and work
---
Growing up, since I was a kid and specially when I was a teenager, the question "What do you want to be when you grow up?" would pop from time to time.
I would ask this question, as well as be asked by well intentioned and loving parents, family, and teachers. This would lead to a discussion on the different
perceived lives of people in all of these fantasy professions. Soccer player, Doctor, Lawyer, Business owner. All these would come with pros and cons that
would shape your life and your potential happiness: "Doctors make a lot of money, but you have to be ok with handling blood and not be easily disgusted" or
"To be an engineer you have to be very smart, you will probably have trouble finding love because there are not too many women in engineering school to hang out with". You have to choose one of these imperfect careers, find a job and work hard, or you will reach the end of your life alone, poor or bitter.

This is all bullshit. There. I said it.

The notion that in order to live a successful, happy life you have to conform to one of these molds, that happiness depends on choosing well _NOW_ while you are a
hormonal teenager that has not had the chance to even experience your own freedom is.. well.. wrong. It is well intentioned, studying hard, being a professional in what you
do and progressively building up the pieces of who you are while collecting experiences is good. It is a very desirable set of qualities and skills to develop in order to bring
goodness into the world. But it also has this side effect of teaching to a young  mind that there is a finite number of ways that you can live a good life, that some things you
enjoy are just not compatible with some others, you are not supposed to enjoy sports AND video games, you are not supposed to be smart and be bored by chess.

From a young age we are taught to fit a set lovingly created image that parents and society built for us, and once we are "free" of these expectations, once out of school and
a full adult, we just don't know who we are. This is ok. We don't know _yet_. But while we figure it out, we turn to our occupation: You are what you work on, the company that you work for, the job title.

In a recent conversation with a new friend, we called this "outsourcing your identity". 

But as time goes by, you do not fit into that definition any more. You are more, beyond what a job title or a resume can express. What to do? well, you search for a new job title, a new company, a new thing to work on: Your next dream job. The problem is, it does not exist, it can't.

There's a couple things why I don't think a dream job can exist, but over all, the notion that happiness and fulfillment will come from just finding the right company at the right time to do the right kind of work and it will solve all your problems comes down to outsourcing your identity. You are not your job, not even the dreamy one, and a dream job just can not exist because it is by definition some thing that you do that someone ELSE needs. You are of course allowed to enjoy your job, love your coworkers and team, and believe in the mission of your company, those are great things and you deserve to have them, but over all be aware: You are not your job, it does not define who you are. _You define who you are_.

## What does this have to do with creativity?

Creativity is such a broad term, and it is so because it expresses the transformation of things from not existing to, well, existing, through the actions of a person. I may be mangling the definition A LOT but I will work with this one.

This transformation does not happen in a vacuum. We need of course a person, and something that does not exist yet so the person can ACT and through this, the thing will now _be_.
But creativity has inputs, this is: _ideas_. When a person's mind is full of ideas, they can combine them and imagine a new thing that they have never seen before. This works at all
levels, but for this reflection, it also works for _you_. The person you will be does not yet exist, but by feeding ideas into your mind and taking action, that person will be created by _you_.

In order to do that, becoming the person you want, your _dream identity_, action is required and this is precisely my point.

If you outsource your identity, happiness, the decisions on how to live your life to something other that is not _you_, you can not create that person that you dream to be.

## Diversify your portfolio

It's a piece of wisdom that's old as poultry farming: Do not put all your eggs in one basket, if the basket breaks you will lose all of your eggs. Spread the risk, diversify your
portfolio. Do not depend on a single thing in your life to define who you are. Job, dream job, partners, children. Those are all pieces of your life, sure, but beyond that, what is it that glues all these pieces together? Who is the person that remains if those things are removed? 

If you don't know it's fine. Take charge of your creativity and define who that person is, then work hard to make them real.
