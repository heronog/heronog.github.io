# Why are we this creepy?

Every year on the International Woman's Day I do nothing. Some people congratulate women, some give gifts out, either to charities that are fighting for their rights or directly to them (wtf).
Some go all the way to buying the women in their lives flowers to cellebrate "the most beautiful creation, the sublimest form of being". WTF creep???!

For me doing nothing is the right thing to do, I just go along my day offering no comment and no opinions to anyone that doesn't ask for them directly.
This is very hard and I do it intentionally. It may not seem much but I try to do my part and shut the fuck up, and I fail more often that I'd like.

Because I do have an opinion, a strong opinion on multiple things that don't concern me at all but I still feel very strongly about and will do anything to bend reality to my will. This is what 
I've been taught to think of as being a man, taking charge, pushing the world forward with the sheer power of our judgment. It's all bullshit and very damaging for everyone, specially to women, who 
on this fantasy world are on the other side of this lie. On this fantasy they are in charge of comforting, inspiring and satisfying our manly desires, no matter what.

The effect on them is bad. It's been documented, but I'll try another argument that may be interesting: It keeps men away from knowing the real world, and by consequence from becoming real men.

# Shut up

Just like in my previous post, I will say that having a strong opinion is a sign of privilege and we should be looking at the way systems and infrastructure help us isolate from the hard thruths of this world.

When we start liking or commenting on IWM posts or activity, or other people's body, looks, actions or ANYTHING that does not concern our life directly what is effectively happening is we are
voicing out our judgment, which means, we are paying attention to things that are further away from our concerns than the ones that are truly ours.

Men's attitude towards life is like having a video call with our family while we are on a first date with someone... and then turning around and having a video call with friends when we are with family. We just don't pay attention, and just concern ourselves with things that are way way way in the realm of fantasy and we've become really good at living there.

This is not what men should be or do. That is for kids. If we want to be real men, we have to be present and use our senses to get grounded in the real world. But to do that we first need to shut up.

# Everything is about sex

The guys that give out flowers on IWM? They think this is a great opportunity to convince someone that they are interested in having sex because, of course, men are always only interested in sex, so that's
what a gentleman does: Sexualize everything. This guys are thinking how they can gain power over someone and have them satisfy their desires. This is what is creepy, they are not only missing the point, they
are being exactly what they need to be free from. But as a man, they have an opinion about this woman and they will be heard!

In this fantasy, everything is about sex, except sex, which is about power.

A couple months ago I was talking about this with a friend and didn't get to my point, so I'll make it here. We men gain honor and recognition among our peers by sexualizing everything. What we try to do is  signal that we're powerful enough to MAKE something satisfy OUR desires.

When our position in the group, our self image, our very identity are grounded on the idea that having power to satisfy our sexual desires is the only thing that matters, things get very very sad.
Can we say if another man is good looking? No, because that would make you vulnerable to him and to satisfy HIS desires.
Can you think about a bidet and not feel vulnerable? No, because since everything is about sex, having a cleaning device touch you in places gives IT power over you. And if somene else finds out, they may want to try to get that power over you too.

# Everything can be about someting else, too.

We've built so many sistems in society that just push this ideas along, we've shaped society and economy and science in ways that make this value of sexualizing everything so easy.
If you are not a man, and the "right kind of man" whatever that is, you do not get to be this sloppy, you do not get to be this lazy. Everyone else needs to work harder and be better just to make up for our failure to see reality.

We value women's abnegation, service, attention to detail, family building. Why are they considered female? I think it's because we men have failed to hold our end, we are
concerned with stuff that has nothing to do with these things, and we are just not functioning. We should all try to be as delicate, polite, inspiring and live our values as we expect others to live them.

These are not women's issues by nature, it's human issues that we are making them fix by force. By shutting up and being present you'll see that they are pressing, very real, and fully our responsibility.
When we stop thinking about things in a purely sexual maner we start realizing that yeah, we've been behaving like an asshole. And it hurts, but we don't have to keep doing it.

So let's stop, and start thinking about things in terms of justice, truth, beauty. Be beautiful, be just and be thruthful, and honor those who are. Those that have not benefited from this
fantasy of sexual power as the ultimate goal.

We'll hopefully find that sex actually has nothing to do with most things.
