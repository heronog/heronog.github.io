# I have a strong opinion on toilet paper.

To me being the least bothered possible is very important. This is specially true for the feeling of cleanliness and relates directly to disgusting but necessary things that have to be done.
Preserving health, feeling confident in one's presence, being free to think about things not related to one's immediate sensations are also very important. Toilet paper is an important part of all this.

So, what is it that I'm looking for in toilet paper? Let's start with a short list of must haves:

* _Absorbent_: Capable of stabilizing liquids quickly. It also helps use the least amount of material, which is important to the environment. Toilet paper is useful in many situations and there are some that require a quick and effective control of
  fluids, either to stop them from spreading or to remove them from surfaces. A good material will do this and prevent users from coming in contact with such liquids.
* _Not soft_: There is a minimum amount of "hardness" required to do an effective job, and to me having a material that is designed to do the job is the most crucial thing in choosing a toilet paper.
  When I see words like "Ultra Soft" or the like in packaging it makes me feel that the appeal is purely psycologic. It will "treat you well", or "feel luxurious". None of these is required for
  it to do a good job, and on the contrary, going too much into the softness will make it worse at it. Have you ever had to dry your face with a piece of ultra soft toilet paper and discovered tiny balls of paper stuck on your cheek? Imagine if it was not your face... disgusting.
* _Not hard_: This is less of a concern to me, but it also makes the material unfit for it's purpose. If it's too hard it won't bend and adapt correctly to the skin and will not reach into the spaces it needs. It can also hurt and make micro cuts in an area that
  should ideally not be compromised. Having a material too hard forces the user to be careful, to compensate, this is not good service either.
* _Not smelly_: Goes both ways, if the material is of low quality it may have some solvent smell. How can we be sure it's not toxic or irritating? For fragances that are applied on purpuse, I say they are stupid and should not exist. They serve no purpose as the
  fragance won't be strong enough for the intended cases, will be too strong for other casual uses, will fade away during normal installation and it's very likely not going to match the preferences of the users. The right amount of smells and fragances in toilet paper is 0

I realize that this is not a complete list, but it's what I feel more strongly about. It should also be affordable, available and integrate into the daily use systems that are around us, from toilet paper holders to the sewage systems where the material dissolves as designed. But these are not really too concerning to me.

# Be like water

During the toilet paper shortage of the COVID-19 pandemic, bidets started gaining popularity. Some of my friends got one in secret and during our "Zoom nights" and "came out" when we were talking about the new trend. Other friends were amused, and others still were curious but doubtful that this would be a good adition to their lives. I have not heard any one that uses one to complain, and on the contrary, their reactions are not neutral but solidly on the positive side. I still have not used one but I find
the prospect intriguing. I am curious to see how _EFFECTIVE_ they are to accomplish the goals stated above: Reduce cognitive load, reduce required physical labor, increase confidence or preserve self image and protect health.

What is curious to me is _WHY_ I have not tried one and why some of my friends were amused. Some others where curious like me but did not _ACT_ on it. Why did they not try it? Why haven't _I_?

Some of it may be the barriers to entry are too high. I will ignore price and availability, these are people with Prime memberships that have no problems getting a USD $60 wine bottle for a get together. Me and my friends are wealthy enough that these barrier is small compared to our capability. So what else is there?

It could also be that the installation seemed too daunting and risky. Unplugging water lines from such a vital facility as a toilet, with the risk of property damage, constant clean up, or simple janky looking fixes. Having a plumber come in to install your bidet in the middle of the pandemic seemed like too much: -_"What if I get sick? What if the plumber gets sick? Are we even allowed to get this service for non emergency issues like a bidet? How much is it gonna take? If I don't like it I'll have to pay again to get it removed!"_. Too much.

To dig deeper, I asked my friends and some thought that it was "funny", thinking that a stream of water is gonna be shot at your butt and it would "feel funny". Others where concerned with the origins of the water, is it coming from the toilet bowl and dirty? (the answer is NO). Others were afraid it would feel uncomfortable. Is the water cold? how cold? is it gonna spill out? is the spout clean? How does it keep clean?. The ones concerned with comfort and cleanliness were women.

The ones worried about the "funny" feeling were all men. We all thought that having a stream of water shot at us for cleaning would feel too sexual in an unknown way. We laughed it off and did not talk about it any more, but I worry that our self image is so fragile, that our identity is so dependent on sexualizing everything that we can't even begin exploring better ways of doing things.

I feel fortunate that my friends, my male friends, are decent men and are open to ask themselves what is it that is preventing them from fully engaging with life, from asking questions about reality instead of focusing on their identity as men being threatened. I love my friends and am so proud of us having deep conversations often. We need more of these, because as concerned as we are about being sexualized by a cleaning device, we should be concerned with solving real problems in the real world.

We have tools and access to knowledge and power that make our life better every day. Becoming aware of this privilege may help us be better humans, better men. On the other hand, the cold water seems like a valid concern to me.

# Privilege

Having a strong opinion on something is an indication of privilege. I said above that for toilet paper availability, affordability, integration into existing infrastructure are also things to consider but not too concerning. What is important to me is to get clean and not have my bathroom smelling of old low quality fragance that may irritate my skin.

This is a privilege because the things that are working for me become invisible. The running water, the working sewage, the materials used in the toilet paper that allow it to break down and not clog pipes, access to professional services in case I need plumbing repairs, access to tools and instruction to do the repairs myself if I choose to, my economic position that allows me to acquire these services or materials and access these prepared spaces and infrastructure.

When I turn around and there are millions and millions of people for whom fragance paper would feel like a true luxury, not because of the fragace but because of the health and cleanlines benefits, when I turn around and I see people in the world without access to running water or working sanitary infrastructure, or even access to economic and financial growth to get their own opinion, I think about how fortunate I am.

Being clean, being healty, being wealthy are things that I am privileged with, and whenever I get disgusted with ultra soft fraganced toilet paper, I think about this, and let it go.
